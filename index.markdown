# FeedPulse API Docs

FeedPulse provides a [RESTFUL](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/) API service that enables access to global trending news. Our API supports standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded replies.

## How it works

You can send requests from your application by making a `HTTP GET` to the `/feeds` endpoint request to the API. For each request sent from your application, we respond with a `JSON` response according to the provided request params.
